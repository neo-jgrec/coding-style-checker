## Scripts to generate coding style reports

This is the interpretation of the coding style checker by [neo-jgrec](github.com/neo-jgrec).
This script is fully automated and be easily use by lazy people like me.

The powershell script  has not been changed, because, who uses powershell anyway?

### Linux
